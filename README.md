# CHLib-Bot-For-Chatango<br>
My take on a simple to use bot for chatango. This is my base source code only. Not the full bot<br>

Update Log:<br>
      Added Youtube Command To Source code. You still need your own API Key for Youtube v3 to use the command<br>
      Fixed a glitch where posts were being ignored. This was due to a bug in the prefix code and the bot trying to use the old prefix<br>
      Added A new system of ranking, users now have levels, money and xp<br>
      Added levels, definitions, new Google Image API<br>
